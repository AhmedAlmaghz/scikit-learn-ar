    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm is an unsupervised anomaly detection method which computes the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. It considers as outliers the samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors. This example shows how to use LOF for outlier detection which is the default use case of this estimator in scikit-learn. Note that when LOF is used for outlier detection it has no predict, decision_function and score_samples methods. See the User Guide &lt;outlier_detection&gt; for details on the difference between outlier detection and novelty detection and how to use LOF for novelty detection.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="Feature 0 (median income in a block) and feature 5 (average house occupancy) of the california_housing_dataset have very different scales and contain some very large outliers. These two characteristics lead to difficulties to visualize the data and, more importantly, they can degrade the predictive performance of many machine learning algorithms. Unscaled data can also slow down or even prevent the convergence of many gradient-based estimators.">

It considers as outliers the samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors. This example shows how to use LOF for novelty detection. Note that when LOF is used for novelty detection you MUST not use predict, decision_function and score_samples on the training set as this would lead to wrong results. You must only use these methods on new unseen data (which are not in the training set).
